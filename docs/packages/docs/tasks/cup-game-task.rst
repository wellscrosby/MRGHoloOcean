Cup Game Task
=============

Calculates reward based on whether the correct cup is touched and whether
the ball is touched.

- A reward of ``1`` is given for one tick if the correct cup is touched and no
  other cups are touched.
- A reward of ``2`` and terminal is given when the ball itself is touched and
  no incorrect cups are touched.
- A reward of ``-1`` and terminal is given when an incorrect cup is touched.

The cup game task only works in the CupGame world in the dexterity package.
The game will not start if a cup game task is not added to an agent.

.. _`cup-game-task-config`:

Configuration
-------------

Each of the following parameters can be placed in the configuration field
for a cup game task sensor (see :ref:`scenario files <scenario-files>`.)

The configuration can also be set programmatically by calling
:meth:`~holoocean.sensors.CupGameTask.start_game` if the sensor has no
configuration block. That configuration will reset after every call to 
:meth:`~holoocean.environments.reset`.

Speed Multiplier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``1.0`` is the base speed, cups will rotate faster with a higher multiplier. 
It is best to keep values between ``1`` and ``10``.

``"Speed": 2.4``


NumShuffles
~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of times the cups are exchanged.

``"NumShuffles": 10``


Seed
~~~~

Seed for the RNG used to shuffle the cups. Providing a fixed seed will result
in a deterministic set of exchanges, which may be useful for training.

If left empty or not defined, the cups will rotate using a randomly generated
seed.

``"Seed": 1``


Example
-------

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Speed": 5.0,
        "NumShuffles": 1,
        "Seed": 0
    }
