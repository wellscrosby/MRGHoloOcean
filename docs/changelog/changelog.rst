Holodeck 0.3.1
--------------
*04/02/2020*

More bug fixes, improvements, and even a few new features.

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~
- **Holodeck now requires Python 3.5 or greater**
- Added :class:`~holoocean.sensors.AbuseSensor` and 
  :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RangeFinderSensor`
- Added programmatic spawning of props, see
  :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.spawn_prop`
- Weather can be specified in scenarios, see :ref:`weather`.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added optional start location and rotation randomization on 
  :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.reset`. See 
  :ref:`location-randomization`.
  (`#295 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/295>`_)
- :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.spawn_prop` now allows 
  basic objects (spheres, cubes, cylinders) to be spawned at arbitrary 
  locations in the environment.
  (`#397 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/397>`_)
- :ref:`distance-task` by default now calculates the distance to the objective
  along the XY plane, to discourage flying straight up.
  (`#360 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/360>`_)

  If the full 3D distance is desired, set the ``3dDistance`` flag in the
  configuration block of the :ref:`distance-task`.
  (`#360 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/360>`_)
- Added :class:`~holoocean.sensors.AbuseSensor`, which senses if an agent
  has been abused. Agents experience abuse when they fall from a high distance
  or other agent-specific situations.
  (`#262 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/262>`_)
- Environment weather/time can be optionally configured with :ref:`scenarios`
  (`#263 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/263>`_). See
  :ref:`weather`.
- :meth:`~holoocean.weather.WeatherController.set_weather` now has sunny
  weather available, which allows you to revert back to the default weather.
  (`#376 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/376>`_)
- Added :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RangeFinderSensor` which calculates the
  distance from the sensor to the first collision in the environment. The 
  sensor can send out multiple rays in a circle if desired.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **Holodeck now requires Python >= 3.5**
  (`#389 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/389>`_)
- Moved weather/time methods from
  :class:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment` to new

  (`#196 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/196>`_,
  `#263 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/263>`_)
- Calling :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.send_world_command`
  for an environment without the given command will now cause
  the environment to exit rather than fail silently.
  This includes all relevant methods in the
  :class:`~holoocean.weather.WeatherController`.
- Removed the ability to toggle sensors during runtime with the removal of
  :class:`~holoocean.environments.command.SetSensorEnabledCommand`,
  :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.set_sensor_enabled`, and
  :meth:`~holoocean.sensors.HolodeckSensor.set_sensor_enable`.
  To specify which sensors to include, use :ref:`custom-scenarios`.
  (`#268 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/268>`_)
- Improved Docker images. See docker.
  (`#347 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/347>`_)

    **UrbanCity-MaxDistance:** Added :class:`~holoocean.sensors.AbuseSensor`
  - **InfiniteForest-MaxDistance:** Added :class:`~holoocean.sensors.AbuseSensor` 
    and :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RangeFinderSensor`.
  - **MazeWorld-FinishMazeSphere:** Added 
    :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RangeFinderSensor`

Holodeck 0.3.0
--------------
*11/02/2019*

This is a content release focused on improving the android-agent and
adding more scenarios and tasks for it. We also added a new floating hand
agent to provide a simpler agent that can do many of the dexterity tasks.

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~
- Added dexterity-package with new worlds and scenarios (see below for
  comprehensive listing)
- Added clean-up-task and cup-game-task tasks
- Added hand-agent

  - playroom-world

    - playroom-android
    - playroom-hand
    - playroom-standfromground
    - playroom-standfromstanding

    - grip-liftbottle

- Added the hand-agent - a simplified Android hand that can float
  around
  (`#287 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/287>`_)

  - HandAgent can be used with the same Android-specific sensors (
    :class:`~holoocean.sensors.JointRotationSensor`,
    :class:`~holoocean.sensors.PressureSensor`,
    :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RelativeSkeletalPositionSensor`)

- Added new tasks sensors for specific worlds

  - :ref:`cup-game-task`
    (`#318 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/318>`_)

  - :ref:`clean-up-task`
    (`#321 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/321>`_)

- Packages can be installed directly from a URL
  (see :class:`~holoocean.packagemanager.install`)
  (`#129 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/129>`_)
- Agent sensors can now be rotated at run time with
  :meth:`~holoocean.sensors.HolodeckSensor.rotate`.
  (`#305 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/305>`_)
- The config files can now specify whether an agent should be spawned
  (`#303 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/303>`_)
- Pressing ``h`` now shows the coordinates of the agent the viewport is
  following or the coordinates of the camera if it is detached (see
  :ref:`hotkeys`).
  (`#253 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/253>`_)
- The viewport now follows the main agent as specified in the
  config file by default.
  (`#238 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/238>`_)
- You can now specify the number of ticks you want to occur in the
  :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.tick` and the
  :meth:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment.step` methods,
  (`#313 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/313>`_)

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Increased the android-agent's strength in the
  ``ANDROID_MAX_SCALED_TORQUES`` control scheme.

  - Previously the AndroidAgent didn't have enough strength to even move its
    legs.
  - Strength was approximately doubled (See
    `JointMaxTorqueControlScheme.h <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck-engine/blob/develop/Source/Holodeck/Agents/Public/JointMaxTorqueControlScheme.h#L50>`_
    )
- Location sensor now returns the location of the sensor, not just the agent
  (`#306 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/306>`_)
- Updated to Unreal Engine 4.22
  (`#241 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/241>`_)
- :ref:`turtle-agent` is now subject to gravity, has increased power,
  is black, and slightly smaller.
  (`#217 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/217>`_)
- Removed the ``set_state()`` and ``teleport()`` methods from the
  :class:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment` class.

  These methods were duplicates of the corresponding methods on the
  :class:`~holoocean.agents.HolodeckAgent` class. See the linked issue for
  migration suggestions ðŸ‘‰
  (`#311 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/311>`_)
- Removed the ``get/set_ticks_per_capture`` methods from the
  :class:`~holoocean.agents.HolodeckAgent` and
  :class:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment` classes, moved
  :meth:`~holoocean.sensors.RGBCamera.set_ticks_per_capture` method to the
  :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RGBCamera` class.
  (`#197 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/197>`_)
- Viewport will now follow the main agent by default.
  (`#238 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/238>`_)
- Viewport will not be rendered when it is hidden (``show_viewport`` param in
  :class:`~holoocean.environments.HoloOceanEnvironment`, Linux only)
  (`#283 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/283>`_)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed the :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RelativeSkeletalPositionSensor`.

  - This sensor returns the location of bones, not sensors. Since there are
    more bones than joints, previously it returned them in a completely
    different order than expected.
  - Now the order for this sensor is explicitly specified in
    android-bones and hand-bones.
  - Previously on the first tick it would return uninitialized garbage on the
    first tick
- Fixed being unable to spawn the :ref:`turtle-agent`.
  (`#308 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/308>`_)
- Fixed the :meth:`~holoocean.agents.HolodeckAgent.set_physics_state` method.
  (`#311 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/311>`_)
- Fixed agent spawn rotations being in the incorrect order. Fixed the
  documentation that specified the incorrect order as well (:ref:`rotations`)
  (`#309 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/309>`_)
- Fixed being unable to set the ticks per capture of a camera if it was not
  named ``RGBCamera``.
  (`#197 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/197>`_)
- Fixed being unable to make a Holodeck window larger than the current screen
  resolution
  (`#301 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/301>`_)
- Fixed being unable to configure :class:`~holoocean.sensors.ViewportCapture`
  sensor.
  (`#301 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/301>`_)

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The TurtleAgent does not move consistently between Linux and Windows.
  (`#336 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/336>`_)
