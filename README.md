[![Read the docs badge](https://readthedocs.org/projects/holodeck/badge/)](https://holodeck.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) ![Build Status](https://jenkins.holodeck.ml/buildStatus/icon?job=holodeck-engine%2Fdevelop)

Holodeck is a high-fidelity simulator for reinforcement learning built on top of Unreal Engine 4.

## Features
 - 7+ rich worlds for training agents in, and many scenarios for those worlds
 - Linux and Windows support
 - Easily extend and modify training scenarios
 - Train and control more than one agent at once
 - Simple, OpenAI Gym-like Python interface
 - High performance - simulation speeds of up to 2x real time are possible. Performance penalty only for what you need
 - Run headless or watch your agents learn

## Usage Overview
Holodeck's interface is similar to [OpenAI's Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). 

We try and provide a batteries included approach to let you jump right into using Holodeck, with minimal
fiddling required.

To demonstrate, here is a quick example using the `DefaultWorlds` package:

```python
import holodeck

# Load the environment. This environment contains a UAV in a city.
env = holodeck.make("UrbanCity-MaxDistance")

# You must call `.reset()` on a newly created environment before ticking/stepping it
env.reset()                         

# The UAV takes 3 torques and a thrust as a command.
command = [0, 0, 0, 100]   

for i in range(30):
    state, reward, terminal, info = env.step(command)  
```

- `state`: dict of sensor name to the sensor's value (nparray).
- `reward`: the reward received from the previous action
- `terminal`: indicates whether the current state is a terminal state.
- `info`: contains additional environment specific information.

If you want to access the data of a specific sensor, import sensors and
retrieving the correct value from the state dictionary:

```python
print(state["LocationSensor"])
```

## Multi Agent-Environments
Holodeck supports multi-agent environments.

Calls to [`step`](https://holodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/holodeck/environments.html#holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.step) only provide an action for the main agent, and then tick the simulation. 

[`act`](https://holodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/holodeck/environments.html#holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.act) provides a persistent action for a specific agent, and does not tick the simulation. After an 
action has been provided, [`tick`](https://holodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/holodeck/environments.html#holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.tick) will advance the simulation forward. The action is persisted until another call to `act` provides a different action.

```python
import holodeck
import numpy as np

env = holodeck.make("CyberPunkCity-Follow")
env.reset()

# Provide an action for each agent
env.act('uav0', np.array([0, 0, 0, 100]))
env.act('nav0', np.array([0, 0, 0]))

# Advance the simulation
for i in range(300):
  # The action provided above is repeated
  states = env.tick()
```

You can access the reward, terminal and location for a multi agent environment as follows:

```python
task = states["uav0"]["FollowTask"]

reward = task[0]
terminal = task[1]
location = states["uav0"]["LocationSensor"]
```

(`uav0` comes from the [scenario configuration file](https://holodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/docs/scenarios.html))

## Running Holodeck Headless
Holodeck can run headless with GPU accelerated rendering. See [Using Holodeck Headless](https://holodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/running-headless.html)
